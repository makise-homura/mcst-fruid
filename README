== Build flavors

* ARM (OpenBMC) binary: uses `mtd` driver to access SPI flash
* Elbrus (e2k) binary: uses `spidev` driver to access SPI flash

== Build

Make targets:

* `make`: Build `mcst-fruid` executable
* `make install`: install it to /usr/local/libexec
* `make uninstall`: remove it from /usr/local/libexec
* `make clean`: clean build area

Make variables:

* `V`: enable verbose mode (1 to enable, 0 (default) to disable)
* `PREFIX`: set another prefix instead of default `/usr/local`
* `DESTDIR`: install to `$(DESTDIR)/$(PREFIX)` instead of `$(PREFIX)`

Build-time dependencies:

* `zlib`
* `libi2c` (from `i2c-tools`)

== Run

Binary is to be run without parameters.

No interaction with `stdin` or `stdout` is presumed, except for error messages to `stderr`.

Run-time dependencies:

* All build-time dependencies (shared libraries)
* `dtc` (from kernel sources)
* Kernel driver `i2c-dev` should be loaded before running
* Kernel driver `at24` should be available prior to running
* Kernel driver `spidev` or `mtd` (depending on build flavor) should be loaded before running
* Directory `/var/volatile` must exist

Output files:

* `/var/volatile/motherboard_info.xml`: motherboard FRU information in XML format
* `/var/volatile/motherboard_devtree.dtb`: binary motherboard device tree
* `/var/volatile/motherboard_devtree.dts`: decompiled motherboard device tree
